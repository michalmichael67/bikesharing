# bikesharing

## Overview 
In New York, there is a successful bikesharing program - NYC Citi Bike Program. In this project, we analyzed data from the NYC bikesharing program to try and draw conclusions about the possible success of a ridesharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to pitch a DM Citi Bike Program, our goal was to get to know the NYC users and bike preferences.

## Results

In this visualization, the goal is to get an overview fo the user profile. 
- Most users are Subscribers
- Most users are Male
- Nost users were both in 1969 and after 1986

----------

![user_type](Resources/user_type.jpeg)

This visualization shows that most users are male subscribers that use the bikes most often on Monday-Friday. This helps us hone in on the largest target audience for the bikesharing program.

----------

![hour](Resources/hour.jpeg)

When we begin to look at a heatmap for when the bikes are taken out and returned each day, it becomes clear that the bikes are used for commuting to work. In the morning, the bikes are mainly used from 7-10 AM and at night from 5-8 PM. When we looked at the same data broken down by gender, the most popular times that bikes were used was unchanged.

----------

![length](Resources/length.jpeg)

Going with our hypothesis that these bikes are used for commuting to work, most trips are under an hour.

----------

![gender_length](Resources/gender_length.jpeg)

When we break the length of trip down by gender, the same pattern holds true.

When trying to understand where users begin their rides, midtown Manhattan stands out on the map - this area corresponds to business hubs.

----------

When looking at where users begin their rides, a similar trend shows most riders dropping their bikes off near business and shopping centers. 

## Summary 

When looking at the data, a few points can be used to help pitch a DM bikesharing program.

- Most users are subscribers which is beneficial because they automatically pay for a monthly bikesharing service. As long as Des Moines has a similar breakdown of subscribers v. customers, they will be profitable. 

- Bikes are used for under and hour and when looking at the average commute time in New York City V Des Moines, the NYC commute is ~40 mins and the Des Moines commutes is ~20 mins. It seems as though the time profile for users could be similar across cities.

- Bike stations need to be placed in highly populated areas. This is important because it shows that a few bike stations places strategically can be as succesfful, if not more successful, that many bike stations places in remote areas. Regarding Des Moines, it is a less populated but it still has concentrated business and shopping centers. If the bike stations are placed in these areas, it could be successful.

Additional visualizations that could be helpful are:
1. A bubble chart showing the most popular age of users (this graph was created and is included in the user profile visual).
2. Building on the importance of understanding the age of the user, a line chart that looks at age v. trip lenth would be helpful in understanding if there are multiple use cases for the bikes broken by age.
3. Similarly to the above idea, we could look at age v. start time to understand when people are using the bikes by age.
